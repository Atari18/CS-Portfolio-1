    The main function of the game.

    This function initiates the game by performing the following steps:
    1. Prints a welcome message and the objective of the game.
    2. Prompts the user to enter their name, select a pet, choose the gender of the pet, and provide the pet's name.
    3. Creates `Player` and `Pet` instances by calling `make_player()` and `make_pet()`, respectively.
    4. Creates a `Shop` instance with predefined inventory items.
    5. Introduces the player and pet using their respective `introduce()` methods.
    6. Displays an image of the pet.
    7. Enters an infinite loop calling `game_menu()` to handle game actions.
